Oggi, dopo 50 anni, è la terza generazione della famiglia a condurre l'azienda, guardando con ambizione il futuro ma avendo sempre a cuore il passato. L'idea lungimirante di Ezio Caraffini, che decise di piantar vigna lungo i confini di Umbria e Toscana, fu dettata da passione e devozione: un semplice gesto in grado di concepire l'impresa futura e di far crescere sinuosi filari di puro Sangiovese. Nel 2006 l'azienda prende forma grazie all'accurata conduzione di Alessandro, che affianca alle viti più anziane nuovi filari di Colorino e Petit Verdot. Le radici si rafforzano, crescono e la collina si tinge di sfumature giovani e nuove.

As parents of toddlers and pre-schoolers, one thing we've found is that lots of places are baby friendly, cafes don't mind your quiet baby in their pram, but an unruley toddler is a different thing. Lately we've been spending our weekends selling, and gift-wrapping baby shower gifts. We've tried to include a mix of popular gifts, thoughtful gifts, useful gifts, gender neutral baby gifts, and gifts under $25.

In 2003 the name was changed to Traf Tractors and Machinery. 15 years of expansion and growth since that time spread Traf Tractors beyond the localised business it once was, with a new branch into Maffra Gippsland and the further expansion into Tasmania with its Longford branch in 2018. The name was then changed to TTMI (Traf Tractors and Machinery Industrial) in April of 2018 to reflect the evolution of the brand.
