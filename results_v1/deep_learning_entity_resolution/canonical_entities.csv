Oggi, dopo 50 anni, è la terza generazione della famiglia a condurre l'azienda, guardando con ambizione il futuro ma avendo sempre a cuore il passato. L'idea lungimirante di Ezio Caraffini, che decise di piantar vigna lungo i confini di Umbria e Toscana, fu dettata da passione e devozione: un semplice gesto in grado di concepire l'impresa futura e di far crescere sinuosi filari di puro Sangiovese. Nel 2006 l'azienda prende forma grazie all'accurata conduzione di Alessandro, che affianca alle viti più anziane nuovi filari di Colorino e Petit Verdot. Le radici si rafforzano, crescono e la collina si tinge di sfumature giovani e nuove.

Historically, commercial truck financing and heavy equipment financing has been difficult for small businesses and semi truck owner operators. We simplify the process and provide transparent and competitive options. From humble beginnings of an inventory of just four pre-owned semi trucks and a small team, to selling around 1,000 used semi trucks each year backed by 150 employees, our mission has remained the same: empowering semi truck owner operators to take control of their futures. We are now the largest buyer of long-hood used Kenworth trucks and used Peterbilt trucks in America. We'll not only buy your used semi truck, but we'll pick it up and pay you that day.

Long considered Philadelphia's main thoroughfare, Broad Street – and much of Center City – by the early 1990's had been steadily declining when visionary then-Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell saw the concept of an ""Avenue of the Arts"" along Broad Street.",Board & Chairs | Performing Art | City Councils | Residential Communities | Creative & Performing Arts | Luxury Residences | Dining Experience | Economic Development | Personalized Art | Residential And Commercial | Non-Profit & Business | Commercial Banking | Architects & Planners | Wealth Managment | Students And Visitors | Service & Events | Academy Of Music | Images & Media | Arts Organization | Holiday Decorating | High Schools | Cultural Venues | Photo Sets | Membership Database | State Courts | Vision Planning | Street Light | LED & Lighting | Physician | Retired Partners | Mapping & Data,Non Profit,Non Profit,Social Services & NGOs,813410,Civic and Social Organizations,,,Social Services & NGOs,NGOs,Non Profit,+12158341976,+12158341976,info@avenueofthearts.org,info@avenueofthearts.org,michele@avenueofthearts.org | laura@avenueofthearts.org,https://www.avenueofthearts.org/,avenueofthearts.org,org,en,https://www.facebook.com/AvenueOfTheArtsInc/,https://twitter.com/avenueofthearts,https://www.instagram.com/avenueofthearts/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/avenue-of-the-arts-inc-,,,,,,Leisure Facilities,SV-LF,Hospitality & Recreation,SV.2,Services,SV,8699 | 8641,"Membership Organizations, NEC (except humane societies, farm business organizations, athletic associations, and travel motor clubs) | Civic, Social, and Fraternal Associations (except condominium and homeowner associations, taxpayers associations, tenants advocacy associations, temperance organizations, and Indian and Alaska Native Tribal Councils)",9499,Activities of other membership organizations n.e.c.,94.99,Activities of other membership organisations n.e.c.,2019-11-24 02:43:15,2024-07-14 11:57:24,8,"Avenue of the Arts, legally known as AVENUE OF THE ARTS INC., is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
