Oggi, dopo 50 anni, è la terza generazione della famiglia a condurre l'azienda, guardando con ambizione il futuro ma avendo sempre a cuore il passato. L'idea lungimirante di Ezio Caraffini, che decise di piantar vigna lungo i confini di Umbria e Toscana, fu dettata da passione e devozione: un semplice gesto in grado di concepire l'impresa futura e di far crescere sinuosi filari di puro Sangiovese. Nel 2006 l'azienda prende forma grazie all'accurata conduzione di Alessandro, che affianca alle viti più anziane nuovi filari di Colorino e Petit Verdot. Le radici si rafforzano, crescono e la collina si tinge di sfumature giovani e nuove.
